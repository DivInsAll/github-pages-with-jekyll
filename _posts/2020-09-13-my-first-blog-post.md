As the title says, this is my first blog post. Currently, I am working towards the Responsive Web Design certificate on freecodecamp.org. I'm on the Applied Accessibility section right now. The course hasn't been too difficult so far, and I am really enjoying learning the code. I think my favorite part about coding is just learning new things. My goal after I finish the Responsive Web Design certificate is to work my way through the rest of the certificates. Due to the pandemic, I have more free time than usual, and I plan to use a lot of that time to learn code. I am looking forward to the Python lessons the most. I have not entirely decided on what I will major in when I go to college, but I am considering majoring in computer science with a focus or minor in either cybersecurity or artifical intelligence/machine learning. Two of the Python certificates appear to directly relate to both of the minors that I am considering. I hope that as I go through the certificates on freecodecamp, I will discover what kind of coding I enjoy the most.
